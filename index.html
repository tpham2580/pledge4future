                <p>We, Sunrise Houston and Houston Youth Climate Strike, are the Space City Youth Alliance. Nationally, Sunrise has built hundreds of hubs and recruited thousands of young organizers across the country. Here in Houston, Sunrise Houston and HYCS have held town halls, protested in the streets, and helped elect transformational candidates. Now, on the eve of this pivotal election, we are working to inspire and unite passionate young people across Houston schools and universities as we prepare for a transformational decade of activism and politics.</p>

                    <h2>OUR TIME IS NOW</h2>

                    <p>From the Inner Loop to the Suburbs, from the Gulf in the East to the Bayous of the West, we are building an unprecedented movement of empowered young people that will not only shape the course of this election, but will define the next decade of politics in the Greater Houston Area. If we are to win the fight for racial, environmental, and economic justice, as H-town’s youth we must not only project our voices, but work methodically to gain power and influence in civic life. We must unite in an unparalleled, inclusive manner that forcefully communicates a vision for a future we know is possible.</p>
                
                    <p>All of that starts with this election. On the Trump administration’s watch, 75 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters have struck, over 1,000 black people have been killed by police, and over 200,000 people have died from COVID-19. We cannot let this continue. Take your first step by filling out and submitting the SCYA pledge to vote on the right.</p>
