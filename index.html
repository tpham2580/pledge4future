                <p>Houston Youth Climate Strike and the Sunrise Movement have built hundreds of hubs and recruited thousands of organizers across the country. It has been no different in Houston, hundreds of organizers have hosted town halls, protested in the streets, and helped elect transformational candidates up and down the ballot.</p>

                <p>From the Inner Loop to the Suburbs, from the Gulf in the East to the Bayous in the West, we are building an unprecedented movement of empowered young people that will not only shape the course of this election, but will define the next decade of politics in the Greater Houston Area. If we are to fight for racial, environmental, and economic justice, H-town’s youth must not only project their voices, but work methodically to gain power and influence in our civic life. We must unite in an unparalleled, inclusive manner that forcefully communicates a vision for a future we know is possible.</p>
                
                <p>All of that starts with this election. Maybe it’s your first one. Maybe you still can’t vote. Maybe you’re nervous. That’s OK. Take a leap of faith and sign this pledge. By signing this pledge your are committing to:</p>
    
                <ol>
                    <li>Vote (if you are eligible)</li>
                    <li>Contact 3 other eligible voters you know</li>
                    <li>If you can't do (2), send this pledge to 3 other passionate young people to get them involved in this movement.</li>
                </ol>
    
                <p>By providing us with your contact information, you will be joining one of the most powerful, diverse networks of young leaders ever assembled across Houston. Securing this election and defending our democracy will be the critical first step. </p>
